# color-shapes-desktop

Color Shapes is a logical desktop game developed in Java, uses JavaFX platform and SQLite database to store permanent data. This game uses my Java library Power Framework. I also use JUnit to create unit tests. I use the Netbeans IDE, Dia, SonarQube and other tools for the development.
